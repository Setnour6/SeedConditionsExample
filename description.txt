Secret Seed Conditions Example by Setnour6.

THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL 1.4.4 MOD!

You can find the source code to this mod here: https://github.com/Setnour6/SeedConditionsExample

This mod is used for testing loot drops based on secret seeds.
So far, this mod tests the Hellbat and Lava Bat NPCs item drops based on which seed you are on.

Drunk World: Flowing Magma Painting
Not The Bees: Crispy Honey Block
For The Worthy: Living Fire Block
10th Anniversary: Burning Spirit Painting
The Constant/Don't Starve: Spicy Pepper
Remix/Don't Dig Up: Flamelash
No Traps: Flame Trap
Zenith/Everything/Get Fixed Boi: Lake of Fire Painting and Living Flame Dye

Do note that you have to kill Hellbats and Lava Bats many times to get the listed items.

I recommend that you use Terrasavr to get a fully researched character so you can get free items to go to the underworld quicker.
I also recommend using this mod with any mods that allow for NPC spawning on-demand (HERO's Mod, Cheat Sheet, etc.)
