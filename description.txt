Secret Seed Conditions Example by Setnour6.

THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL 1.4.4 MOD!
You can fully utilize this mod by going to the tModLoader GitHub Repository, going to the integrated wiki on the repository, following the 'I want to contribute to tModLoader' steps (make sure to 'regenerate source' after setup), then play 1.4.4 tModLoader, and lastly enabling this mod.

This mod is used for testing loot drops based on secret seeds.
So far, this mod tests the Hellbat and Lava Bat NPCs item drops based on which seed you are on.

Drunk World: Flowing Magma Painting
Not The Bees: Crispy Honey Block
For The Worthy: Living Fire Block
10th Anniversary: Burning Spirit Painting
The Constant/Don't Starve: Spicy Pepper
Remix/Don't Dig Up: Flamelash
No Traps: Flame Trap
Zenith/Everything/Get Fixed Boi: Lake of Fire Painting and Living Flame Dye

I recommend that you use Terrasavr to get a fully researched character so you can get free items to go to the underworld quicker.
